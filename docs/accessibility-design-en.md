# â™¿ Accessibility Design Considerations

## Overview

The University Application Tracking System strictly adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, ensuring that all users, including those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities, can use the system features equally.

## Accessibility Design Principles

### Perceivable
Information and UI components must be presented in ways users can perceive:
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Provide captions and text descriptions for multimedia content
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Support text scaling without loss of functionality

### Operable
UI components and navigation must be operable:
- All functionality accessible via keyboard
- Users have sufficient time to read and use content
- Content does not cause seizures or vestibular disorders
- Help users navigate and find content

### Understandable
Information and UI operations must be understandable:
- Text content is readable and understandable
- Content appears and operates in predictable ways
- Help users avoid and correct errors

### Robust
Content must be robust enough to be reliably interpreted by various assistive technologies:
- Compatible with current and future assistive technologies
- Use semantic HTML structures
- Provide complete programmatic information

## Visual Accessibility Design

### Color and Contrast
- **Contrast Standards**: Text-to-background contrast ratio at least 4.5:1, large text at least 3:1
- **Color-blind Friendly**: Don't rely solely on color to convey information, supplement with icons and text
- **Status Representation**: Use multiple visual elements to represent status (color + icon + text)
- **High Contrast Mode**: Support system high contrast themes

### Typography and Layout
- **Font Size**: Base font no smaller than 16px, support 200% scaling
- **Line Spacing**: At least 1.5x line height to improve readability
- **Font Selection**: Use system fonts for optimal rendering
- **Responsive Text**: Mobile devices automatically adjust to larger font sizes

### Visual Focus
- **Focus Indicators**: Prominent focus rings with contrast ratio at least 3:1
- **Focus Order**: Logical focus movement sequence
- **Skip Links**: Provide links to skip to main content
- **Focus Management**: Focus trapping for modals and dynamic content

## Keyboard Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation Support
- **Tab Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via Tab key
- **Arrow Key Navigation**: Lists and menus support arrow key navigation
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Common functions provide keyboard shortcuts
- **Focus Trapping**: Focus cycling within modals

### Keyboard Operation Standards
- **Enter Key**: Activate buttons and links
- **Space Key**: Activate buttons and checkboxes
- **Escape Key**: Close modals and dropdown menus
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between related controls

### Custom Component Keyboard Support
- **Dropdown Menus**: Arrow key selection, Enter confirmation
- **Date Pickers**: Arrow key navigation, Enter selection
- **Tabs**: Arrow key tab switching
- **Data Tables**: Arrow key navigation between cells

## Screen Reader Support

### Semantic HTML
- **Proper Heading Hierarchy**: Use h1-h6 to establish clear document structure
- **Semantic Tags**: Use header, nav, main, section, article tags
- **List Structures**: Appropriate use of ul, ol, and dl tags
- **Table Semantics**: Correct use of thead, tbody, th, td

### ARIA Attributes Application
- **Role Identification**: role attribute clarifies element roles
- **State Attributes**: aria-expanded, aria-selected and other states
- **Label Association**: aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby
- **Live Regions**: aria-live announces dynamic content changes

### Form Accessibility
- **Label Association**: Each input control has clear labels
- **Error Messages**: Error messages associated with corresponding fields
- **Required Field Identification**: Clearly identify required fields
- **Input Format**: Provide input format instructions and examples

## Animation and Interaction Accessibility

### Animation Control
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user's reduced motion preference settings
- **Animation Duration**: Animation duration not exceeding 3 seconds
- **Controllable Animation**: Users can pause, stop, or hide animations
- **Essential Motion**: Only use animation when enhancing understanding

### Interaction Feedback
- **Status Feedback**: Provide clear status feedback after operations
- **Loading States**: Display progress indicators for long operations
- **Error Handling**: Friendly error messages and recovery suggestions
- **Confirmation Mechanisms**: Important operations require user confirmation

## Mobile Accessibility

### Touch Target Optimization
- **Minimum Size**: Touch targets at least 44x44 pixels
- **Spacing Requirements**: At least 8 pixels spacing between touch targets
- **Gesture Alternatives**: Provide simple alternatives for complex gestures
- **Touch Feedback**: Clear touch feedback effects

### Mobile Screen Readers
- **VoiceOver**: iOS device optimization
- **TalkBack**: Android device optimization
- **Reading Order**: Reasonable screen content reading sequence
- **Navigation Landmarks**: Clear page structure and navigation identification

## Multilingual Accessibility

### Language Identification
- **Page Language**: HTML lang attribute sets page primary language
- **Regional Language**: Local language identification for mixed language content
- **Language Switching**: Clear language switching functionality
- **Direction Support**: Text direction support for right-to-left languages

### Cultural Adaptation
- **Localization**: Consider usage habits from different cultural backgrounds
- **Content Adaptation**: Interface adaptation for text length variations
- **Date Formats**: Date and time formats conforming to local customs
- **Number Formats**: Localized number and currency formats

## Cognitive Accessibility

### Content Understanding
- **Simple Language**: Use clear and concise language expression
- **Logical Structure**: Content organization with clear logical relationships
- **Consistency**: Interface elements and interactions remain consistent
- **Help Information**: Provide necessary usage instructions and help

### Error Prevention
- **Input Validation**: Real-time input validation with friendly prompts
- **Operation Confirmation**: Confirmation mechanisms before important operations
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages and solutions
- **Operation Undo**: Support undoing important operations

## Accessibility Testing

### Automated Testing
- **axe-core**: Integrate automated accessibility detection
- **Lighthouse**: Use Lighthouse accessibility scoring
- **Continuous Integration**: Include accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
- **Regression Testing**: Regular accessibility regression testing

### Manual Testing
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Operate system entirely with keyboard
- **Screen Readers**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- **Magnification**: Test functionality integrity at 200% zoom
- **Contrast**: Verify color contrast meets standards
